### Hello, my name is Turgut,

I am a self-taught developer and chess player; living in Istanbul, Turkey. I have a recipes blog at: [GizliTarif.com](https://www.gizlitarif.com)[^1] since 2011.

My story started in 1995, there was a pitch black screen[^2]. It was extraordinarily exciting for me the computer to understanding the "words" I typed on this black screen and responding to me. Today, I am still trying to communicate with computers by this "words" and still feeling very excited about it.

My first web page was about a game called Outlive (2001).[^3] I created the game's wiki page by translating the game mechanics into Turkish and using HTML.

Computers have always been a passion for me but software development was just a hobby until the end of 2021. I've decided to build my career on front-end web development from now on, and that's what I'm working towards.
