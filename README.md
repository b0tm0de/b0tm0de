### Hello,

I am a self-taught developer and chess player; living in Istanbul, Turkey. I have a recipes blog at: [GizliTarif.com](https://www.gizlitarif.com)[^1] since 2011.
My blog was suprisingly populer at first couple years (daily 8k - 12k users). Once upon a time, GoogleðŸ¤– punished my SEO experiments badly. I have many experiments gone wrongðŸ˜…!

My story started in 1995, there was a pitch black screen[^2]. It was extraordinarily exciting for me the computer to understanding the "words" I typed on this black screen and responding to me. Today, I am still trying to communicate with computers by this "words" and still feeling very excited about it.

I built my first website; one year after, "year 2000 problem[^3]". Website was about a game, called "Outlive"[^4]. I created the game's wiki page using HTML by translating the game mechanics into Turkish.

Computers have always been a passion for me but software development was just a hobby until the end of 2021. I've decided to build my career on front-end web development from now on, and that's what I'm working towards.

I use Windows as the main OS, but occasionally; distro hopping. My favorite distro is Arch and favorite desktop environment is KDE Plasma.

Tech stack I currently use for web development: React, Bootstrap, Wordpress, Git, NPM

In 2001, I updated the BIOS of my computer's motherboard with another brand's motherboard and the computer did not turn on (POST) again, until it was sent for service. The service almost took the money for a new motherboard and reprogrammed the BIOS chip with an external device. Lesson? Let's see.

Back in 2009 I overclocked my laptop's video card via BIOS, it got too hot and the chip broke beyond repair. Lesson? Let's see.

In 2019, to overclock the GeForce GTX 1050 TI graphics card of my newly purchased desktop computer, I edited the card's BIOS and wrote it to the chip. I couldn't get a picture on display anymore, the video card was not operable by any motherboard in this state, because I had corrupted the voltage values of the chip. Lesson? Let's see.

I remember what happened to me in 2001. It's 2019 now, so I was struck by the idea that there might be devices on the market that can write chips externally. I googled a few questions and after some reading I found a device[^5] and bought it. Although it might work in theory, I had no idea what I was doing. I also asked a few questions on Youtube and watched videos. Then I found the original BIOS of my video card from the internet and downloaded it, and I plugged this newly purchased device into another working computer. I used the original BIOS file and that device to reprogram the chip with information I learned from Youtube videos 15 minutes ago. ðŸŽ‰Hooray!ðŸŽ‰ 1050TI started working again.

At first glance, people may think, that I haven't learned a lesson from these experiences, bacause I will break things again, this is obvious right? Or at least lesson that I learned is "you shouldn't break things you don't know, by playing with curiosity". Wrong!

These were exciting things to learn for me. A little detail I learned from the service disaster that happened to me in 2001 turned into a miracle 18 years later.  Break things, build things, repeat. That's the lesson for me...
