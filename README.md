### Hello,

I am a self-taught software developer and chess player; living in Istanbul, Turkey. I have a recipes blog at: [GizliTarif.com](https://www.gizlitarif.com)[^1] since 2011.
My blog was suprisingly populer at first couple years (daily 8k - 12k users). Once upon a time, GoogleðŸ¤– punished my SEO experiments badly. I did a lot of experiments that went wrong.

My story started in mid 90's, there was a pitch black screen[^2]. It was extraordinarily exciting for me the computer to understanding the commands I typed on this black screen and responding to me. Today, I am still trying to communicate with computers and still feeling very excited about it.

I built my first website; one year after, "year 2000 problem[^3]". Website was about a game, called "Outlive[^4]". I created the game's wiki page using HTML by translating the game mechanics into Turkish.

Computers have always been a passion for me but software development was just a hobby until the end of 2021. I've decided to build my career on front-end web development from now on, and that's what I'm working towards.

I use Win10 as the main OS, but occasionally; distro hopping. My favorite distro is Arch and favorite desktop environment is KDE Plasma.

Tech stack I currently use for web development: React, Bootstrap, Wordpress, Git, NPM

<summary>Other technologies that I am familiar with:</summary>
Tailwind, SCSS, Phyton, PHP, Dart (Flutter), Gulp, AdSense, Google Ads (AdWords), Hosting & Domain, VPS/VDS, Plesk, Cpanel, SEO.

In 2001, I updated the BIOS of my computer's motherboard with another brand's motherboard, and the computer did not turn on (POST) again until it was sent for service. The service almost charged me for a new motherboard and reprogrammed the BIOS chip with an external device. Lesson learned? Let's see.

In 2009, I overclocked my laptop's video card via BIOS, causing it to overheat and break beyond repair. Lesson learned? Let's see.

In 2019, I tried to overclock the newly purchased desktop computer's GeForce GTX 1050 TI graphics card by editing its BIOS and writing it to the chip. However, I corrupted the voltage values of the chip, causing the video card to be inoperable with any motherboard. Lesson learned? Let's see.

I remembered what happened to me in 2001, and in 2019, I had an idea that there might be devices on the market that could write chips externally. I googled a few questions, read some articles, and found a device[^5] that I bought. Although it might have worked in theory, I had no idea what I was doing. I also asked a few questions on YouTube and watched videos. Then I found the original BIOS of my video card on the internet, downloaded it, and plugged this newly purchased device into another working computer. I used the original BIOS file and the device to reprogram the chip with information I had learned from YouTube videos 15 minutes earlier. ðŸŽ‰Hooray!ðŸŽ‰ My GPU started working again.

At first glance, people may think that I haven't learned a lesson from these experiences because I will break things again, right? Or at least the lesson that I learned is "you shouldn't break things you don't know about by playing with curiosity." Wrong!

These were exciting things for me to learn. A little detail that I learned from the service disaster that happened to me in 2001 turned into a miracle 18 years later. Break things, build things, repeat. That's the lesson for me...
